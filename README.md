# Weekly Pick'em
This Single page app was created in just over four days by Al Artesona & Will Scirpps
We wanted an easy to use app for betting against friends, family, and co-workers about the NFL games each week.

We would have liked to have used an external API for the spreads, scores, and other team info but they all cost money and we don't have any. All of the data is written in manually from the command line. Running the console and typing `Game.game_results` will enter you into a prompt to enter the winners/losers for each game each week. This is mainly to prevent any user from changing the data on their own.

The frontend uses JavaScript and jQuery. Plenty of conditional formatting to keep the user up-to-date with their picks and game results.
